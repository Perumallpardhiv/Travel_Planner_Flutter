It is a Flutter Application that redefines the trip-planning experience by intelligently addressing the common challenges associated with coordinating travel arrangements with friends. Traditional trip planning often encounters obstacles such as difficulties in reaching a unanimous decision on the places to visit, determining the optimal number of days for the trip, and managing the budget effectively.
